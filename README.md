# Scripts
This is just a collection of scripts and other code snippets. I do not guarantee for correctness or actuality. Feel free to use the scripts as you like. Most of them I created privately to relieve me of monotonous tasks, others are requests from friends and acquaintances, others are created in the context of studies or seminars. 
With kind regards
